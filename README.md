## To do

Next

Short-term
- Fix hj sofa male animation!
- Test all files in a new copy of SA to make sure everything is in order. This copy is already done in E:\GTA San Andreas
- highligh 'save - load - delete' selected option in save menu
- Fade in/out when loading/changing a pose. Perhaps it doesn't need the fade when stopping.
- Compatibility with classic mode.

Long-Term
- Better "change animations" system (replace the clickable in only one block 1 2 3 animations by separated buttons).
- Show in "select pose and place" menu (sexual menu) if is there saved offsets available
- Change Free and FPV cams functionality. Deactivate cursor control when having these cam modes actived, and back from these modes with a single click.
- Make a very simple functionality in SexTriggerer that change player to male skin and spawns the female character that will follow him everywhere, then initiate the SexMachine when they get close enough.

Bugs
- Disable speed bar from clicking when on edit mode of fpv or fixed cameras.
- Perhaps cameras don't save from 'actors offsets' menu save button.
- Looks like z don't increase progressively like x or y (actors offsets menu).
- Looks like cameras menu doesn't save an interior's line contiguous to the other lines in same interior.
- Climax stops from rising at some point, maybe after cameras menu.
